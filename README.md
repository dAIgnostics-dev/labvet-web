# labvet-web — LabVet Studio

Product website for **LabVet Studio**, the dAIgnostics platform for veterinary
practices, referral clinics and veterinary pathology laboratories. The landing
page opens with the product intro (headline, copy and hero photo, then a feature
grid) and continues into the interactive **Core Stack** presenting the four
platform layers:

| Layer | Role |
|---|---|
| dAI Clarity | Objašnjivo izvještavanje prema kliničarima (audit-ready output) |
| dAI Inference Engine | Verzionirani analitički tijekovi rada s Model-Agnostic učitačem |
| dAI DataHub | Upravljana baza podataka s punom sljedivošću (provenance) |
| dAI Edge | Sigurna ingestija i lokalna harmonizacija (sovereignty layer) |

## Stack

Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS — no frameworks, no build step. English is the default
language (site root); the Croatian version lives in `hr/`, with a language
switch (HR/EN pill) in the header of every page.

- `index.html` — landing page ("LabVet Studio"): intro copy + hero photo, feature grid, then the interactive stack (English)
- `solutions.html` / `use-cases.html` — English marketing pages
- `hr/index.html`, `hr/rjesenja.html`, `hr/primjene.html` — Croatian versions
- `css/style.css` — brand tokens from daignostics.info (red `#E21E3A` / `#BB1930`,
  ink `#302D2D`, Inter + self-hosted Adarsh Sans), isometric 3D scene, responsive
  breakpoints (360 px → wide desktop), `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- `js/main.js` — interaction state machine (hover / click / touch / keyboard),
  SVG leader lines, entrance choreography, hover self-reconciliation
- `assets/` — official dAIgnostics logo (`daignostics-logo.png`, transparent, trimmed from the 900x900 master), favicon, Adarsh Sans font, hero photo (`hero-labvet.jpg`)

## The isometric stack

The centerpiece is a real CSS-3D scene: `rotateX(55deg) rotateZ(45deg)` with
`preserve-3d` and **no** perspective (parallel projection, like the reference
diagram). Each layer is a native `<button>` with three faces (top / south /
east). Hovering (desktop) previews a layer; click / tap / Enter pins it and
opens its feature panel. Dotted SVG leader lines connect each layer's right
vertex to its card on ≥1024 px viewports.

⚠️ Do not set `opacity`, `filter`, `clip-path`, `mask`, `contain` or
non-visible `overflow` on `.scene`, the slab wrappers, or any of their
ancestors — each silently flattens the 3D stack (see the FLATTENING RULES
comment block in `style.css`).

## Run

Static files — any web server works:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

## Notes

- This repository started as a copy of `labmed-web`. Solutions, Use cases,
  the header dropdowns and the Core Stack card copy now carry veterinary
  content derived from the landing-page feature copy; the use cases are
  illustrative scenarios, not client case studies.
- The Croatian landing copy (`hr/index.html` intro + feature grid) is a
  translation of the English text, not client-supplied copy — proofread it.

- CTA links (`mailto:contact@daignostics.info`) are placeholders — point them at
  the real demo-request channel.
- The Inference Engine caption uses **„verzioniranih"** (versioned); the source
  diagram said „verziranih", which means *well-versed* in Croatian.
